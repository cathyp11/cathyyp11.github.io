            <p><i>"Record Your Memory"</i></p>
            <p>Many travelers plan ahead of their trip for their hotels, routes, and restaurants through Google Doc, Microsoft Word, and Excel. Currently, there isn’t a specialized platform or app that addresses this specific inconvenience of travelers. “Travelr” allows the users to keep track of their journey and organize them in sub-sections with more detail. Through this app, users can view their trip routes both on a list and a map with the places that they have visited or want to visit in the future. All elements such as locations, dates, and budgets are all manageable in one app.</p>
            <p class="head">Problem Statement</p>
            <p>Travelers want an easy way to keep all the travel information to easily organize and refer back to the places they've visited.</p>

            <p>
                According to user A, the flow of the app isn't smooth when the user clicks on "start exploring" after sending an email to reset their password. When the user expects the page with re-login, the dashboard page pops up instead, which doesn't make sense since you're not logged in. Another confusion user A felt was the location and design of the buttons. On "Trip Creation" screens, "cancel" and "next" buttons seem out of reach and don't look like clickable buttons. User A wishes there are more button-like designs so users don't get confused on where to click. From user B, the cards on the profile seemed clickable but they actually weren't. For now, I designed the cards as displaying simple statistics for each profile, however, I'm more than open to design further to have detailed statistics screen.

            <p class="head">Expected Outcome</p>
            <p>
                Through this app, people can easily export them in different formats and share with others about their trips. Without combining multiple tools to create map visuals and trip lists, this app can do everything at one place. The users will be able to save time and be convenient in managing their trips along with their budgets. In the future, this app can integrate social media so the users can post their trips within the app to share with other users. By integrating social media platform, the users will be able to follow their favorite trips or travelers and keep track of their own followers as well.
