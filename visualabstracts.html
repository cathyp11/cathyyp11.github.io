            <p>A Visual Abstract is a type of infographic that visually summarizes an article or a paper, in other words a visual format of the abstract. It convey the key concepts of the paper and easily translates to the users to understand the article at a glance rather than reading through the actual paper or the abstract but they usually don't contain all the details of an article. It is commonly used on social media such as Twitter to grab attention while users scroll through their feed.</p>
